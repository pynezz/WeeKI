## Command Structure

### Agent Hierarchy
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator that distributes tasks and monitors overall progress
- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific agents with specialized capabilities (coding, design, research, etc.)
- **Utility Agents**: Handle routine tasks like data processing, formatting, and communication

### Decision Flow
1. You provide high-level directives to the Orchestrator
2. Orchestrator breaks down tasks and assigns to appropriate Specialist/Utility agents
3. Results flow back up through the hierarchy for your review
